# Letter Before Action? You're Probably Doing It Wrong.

A Letter Before Action (LBA), also known as a Letter of Claim under the pre-action protocols, is supposed to be a serious, final step in a dispute. It's the equivalent of saying, *"I've tried literally everything else - here is your final chance before I take this to court"*.

In practice, however, many consumers treat an LBA like a magical spell. Find template on the Internet, copy, paste, send... and wait for justice to fall from the sky.

Let's talk about the most common ways people misuse LBA's, and why it matters.

## 1. Using a template like it's a legal Swiss Army knife

Templates are fine as guides, but they're rarely effective as one-size-fits-all solutions.

Most online LBA templates are:

- too aggressive
- too generic
- too vague
- not tailored to the actual dispute

A good LBA needs to reflect your actual situation - the facts, your desired outcome and the losses you're going to claim at court. A template can't do that for you. At best, it's a starting point. At worst, it's a liability.

## 2. Treating the LBA as a tick-box exercise instead of a genuine final step

Many consumers jump straight to an LBA because:

- they're frustrated
- they think it will "scare" the business
- they found a template that told them to
- they've seen advice online that boils everything down to "LBA and MCOL"

Online forums often reduce complex disputes to a two‑step mantra: send an LBA, then file a Money Claim Online. It sounds decisive and empowering! But it skips over all the nuance, evidence-gathering, and communication that should happen first.

An LBA isn't a formality, it's a warning shot. And you don't fire a warning shot unless you're already locked and loaded.

If you have not actually tried to resolve the issue first, clearly and calmly in writing, your LBA looks premature. The trader and the court will notice that, and it weakens your credibility.

## 3. Failing to specify the actual claim

You can't simply say: *"Fix it or I'll take you to court"*.

That's not a claim. That's a tantrum, yet that is exactly what some LBA's we've read say.

An LBA should be calm, specific and grounded in fact. It must include:

- the exact amount you intend to claim
- how you calculated it  
- what legal cause of action you're relying on
- what you want instead of litigation 
- a clear deadline for response

If you cannot specify the amount, show how you calculated it and identify a cause of action, the trader has no way to undestand what you are alleging. If you later issue a civil claim, those same gaps become real problems. The court expects you to set out your losses, calculations, and legal basis with clarity. The LBA is your chance to think things through properly and work out what your claim is and whether it stands up.

A vague LBA is arguably worse than no LBA. A tantrum gets ignored; a clear claim gets taken seriously.

## 4. Sending an LBA before the facts are even clear

Sometimes, people are so eager to 'escalate' that they send an LBA before the groundwork is done.

This happens very often. People send LBAs when:

- they haven't gathered evidence  
- they haven't documented the issue  
- they don't know what they're actually entitled to  
- they haven't even asked the trader to fix the problem yet  

An LBA is the end of the escalation ladder, not the beginning.

If you fire it off too early, you will almost certainly need to send a second one later. Your first letter was incomplete, inaccurate, or based on assumptions, and now you need to correct those, further delaying your claim.

Which leads to…

## 5. Looking silly when you have to climb back down

Few things undermine your position more than:

- sending an aggressive LBA  
- realising you got the facts wrong  
- sending a second LBA correcting yourself  
- or worse, quietly pretending the first one didn't happen

Every time you revise your position, contradict yourself, or escalate prematurely, you lose authority and look less credible and reasonable. If you ever do end up in court, the other side will absolutely point this out. The court may also take your failure to properly follow the pre-action protocols into account when considering costs. Even if you win, you may still end up paying for the court's time or the other side's fixed‑cost expenses.

## 6. Forgetting that an LBA is part of your evidence

Everything you write in an LBA is something a judge may later read. Judges want to know how we got here. They look at the paper trail to see whether you acted reasonably, escalated proportionately and gave the trader a fair chance to resolve the issue before litigation.

If your letter is:

- emotional
- messy
- vague  
- legally confused  
- threatening without substance  
- copied from a template with irrelevant sections

…it becomes evidence *against* you.

We have sat in a courtroom and listened to a judge chastise parties for, in his words, *"clicking a button on the internet and generating seven pages of nonsense"*. He went on to say, *"I will not embarrass you by asking you to explain any of the forty case citations you included."*

A good LBA shows you are reasonable, informed and serious. And if you make a claim, you should refer to it properly in your witness statement, because the court will expect your evidence to match the case you set out at the start.

## 7. Assuming an LBA is a shortcut to compliance

Despite popular belief, an LBA is not a magic intimidation tool. Businesses, especially larger ones, receive LBAs frequently and can tell the difference between:

- a well-prepared claimant who understands their rights  
- and someone who downloaded a template and fired it off in frustration  

A sloppy emailed chain padded with generic template language, demanding remedies you are not entitled to and misquoting legislation you do not understand looks amateurish and will not have the effect you think it will. It looks even worse when your template politely "offers ADR" while you simultaneously refuse to use the ADR scheme that is already open to you.

# So what should an LBA be?

A well-constructed LBA is:

- clear  
- specific
- evidence-based
- legally grounded
- proportionate
- a *genuine* invitation to resolve the dispute

It's not a threat, a formality or a template exercise. **It's a final opportunity for both sides to avoid court**.

There is a reason **most civil cases never reach trial**: many are issued on a whim and only settle later once the parties properly look at the issues. The court expects that, before issuing proceedings, parties exchange enough information to understand each other’s position, decide how to proceed, try to settle, consider ADR, support efficient case management and reduce costs.

Your LBA should contribute towards this objective. It should bring the parties back to the table, focus the issues and create a genuine opportunity to resolve the dispute without litigation.

Dispute resolution begins long before an LBA is drafted. The earlier the issues are identified and understood, the easier it is to steer the dispute towards a sensible outcome. We help consumers do this from the very beginning so that by the time an LBA is sent, it actually moves the dispute forward constructively rather than escalating it unnecessarily.

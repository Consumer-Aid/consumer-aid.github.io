# The BNPL Trap: Convenience at a Cost

Buy Now, Pay Later. It looks like the perfect deal: split your payments, pay no interest, and walk away with your purchase today. But behind the glossy marketing lies a trap, one that leaves UK consumers without the protections they'd expect from traditional credit.  

BNPL agreements are typically structured to be repaid within 12 months, without interest. This is by design to fit into exemptions under the Consumer Credit (Exempt Agreements) Order. The Consumer Credit Act (CCA) was written written decades ago and has quickly become outdated whilst new credit providers have scaled rapidly.  

The exemption loophole creates serious consumer rights gaps. BNPL purchases don’t provide Section 75 protection, so you can’t claim against the lender if goods are faulty or not delivered. Complaints also cannot be escalated to the Financial Ombudsman Service under current rules. Providers aren't even required to carry out affordability checks, but they'll happily add late fees and penalties.  

With that said, if a BNPL purchase goes wrong today, consumers can still take practical steps:
1. Contact the retailer - under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the seller is still responsible for faulty, misdescribed, or undelivered goods.
2. Use the BNPL provider’s complaints process - submit a complaint and keep records of all correspondence.
3. Try a bank chargeback - if your BNPL payments were linked to a debit card, ask your bank to initiate a chargeback.
4. Seek help from Consumer Aid - we can provide guidance, draft complaint letters, and advise on next steps including using the county court ("small claims court").

The government has said that from late 2026, BNPL agreements will be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), but until then it's convenience will continue to come at a cost.

# Casework: Laptop Repair Gone Wrong

We recently supported a consumer through a frustrating dispute with a computer repair shop, a situation that raised clear issues under UK consumer rights. It’s a great example of how early our intervention made all the difference. Often, parties get drawn into peripheral details that only cloud the dispute and frustrate both sides. By approaching the issue calmly and objectively, we were able to open a more constructive dialogue than the consumer might have achieved on their own, helping move the dispute toward a fair resolution.

The consumer initially took their gaming laptop to a local repair shop for a straightforward display replacement. The device was fully functional aside from the damaged screen. However, after the attempted repair, the laptop no longer powered on. We advised the consumer to seek an independent assessment.

A third‑party technician examined the device and identified clear signs of damage to the logic board. They confirmed that this damage was consistent with poor workmanship, and that a laptop in this condition would never have been able to boot at all. In other words, the faults could not have been present before the repair attempt.

Armed with this report, we contacted the repair shop on the consumer’s behalf. Our goals: to outline the findings, explain the consumer’s rights, and open the door to a constructive settlement conversation. After a series of discussions, we successfully negotiated a settlement that addressed the damage and provided the consumer with a fair outcome.

This case demonstrates how evidence and a measured approach can prevent disputes from becoming lengthy or costly, and it shows that consumers aren’t expected to handle these situations by themselves. It also underlines how UK consumer rights and consumer protection laws help customers when repairs go wrong, and we’re here to support you in working towards a fair solution.

# Being Ignored by UK Trading Standards? Here's What You Can Do Next

Reaching out to Trading Standards can feel like shouting into the void.

You report a trader who's treated you unfairly, the case gets routed through Citizens Advice… and what do you get? A reference number. That is it. No updates, no resolution, just a string of digits you definitely cannot use to fix your car or pay for dinner.

It may feel like a dead end, but it's really just a sign that you are in the wrong lane. Reporting a trader is about enforcement, not personal resolution, which is why nothing moves forward from your side.

There is good news, you aren't stuck. Even if Trading Standards won't step in, you still have clear, effective routes to get your issue resolved.

## Why Trading Standards Might Not Respond

Trading Standards rarely handle complaints directly anymore. Everything now goes through Citizens Advice, and Trading Standards only pick up cases that meet certain enforcement thresholds. Even then, tight budgets mean they focus on the bigger picture, looking at patterns, risks and issues that affect the wider public rather than individual cases.

So if you don't hear back, it doesn't mean your case isn't valid. It's simply a sign of how the current system is structured, with individual disputes left for civil routes instead.

## Gather Your Evidence

If you're thinking about taking things further, evidence is your foundation. Collect:
- Contracts, invoices, receipts
- Letters, e-mails, messages, call logs
- Photos or videos
- Notes of what happened and when
- Any expert reports or quotes

The clearer your evidence, the stronger your position in any civil claim.

## Understanding Your Consumer Rights and What You Want

You don't need to quote pages of legislation, but you should understand your basic rights. Under UK consumer law (the Consumer Rights Act 2015), goods must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose and as described, and services must be carried out with reasonable care and skill. Knowing these principles helps you explain your position clearly without getting lost in legal jargon.

You also need to be clear about the outcome you want. Is it reasonable and proportionate? If a neutral third party would say *"that seems fair"*, it's probably reasonable. Consumer protection law is designed to put you back where you should have been, but it doesn't give you anything extra.

## Write to the Trader (Properly) Before Anything Else

Before you can take legal action, you're expected to contact the trader directly and give them a fair chance to put things right. This is where many people slip up, wording things emotionally, threatening legal action too early, or including details that cloud the issue. Stay factual and concise to improve your position.

This is exactly why we created our post, [Letter Before Action? You’re Probably Doing It Wrong](https://blog.consumeraid.co.uk/2025/12/30/Letter-Before-Action-LBA-Youre-Doing-It-Wrong.html), which highlights the common mistakes that can undermine your case.

And if writing feels overwhelming, we can step in and handle the first contact for you, ensuring it is structured and framed correctly from the outset.

## If They Still Ignore You: Consider a Civil Claim

If the trader doesn't respond or refuses to resolve the issue, you can escalate to a civil claim for money. Claims under £10,000 are usually allocated to the small claims track, often referred to as the Small Claims Court, and are typically handled by consumers directly rather than by expensive solicitors or barristers.

It's still a formal legal process and there are parts that can trip people up, such as not following pre-action steps properly or filing something incorrectly. We can provide general guidance on how to structure and present your case clearly, helping you avoid these common pitfalls. We can't run the case for you, but we can help you start it on the right footing if you need that support.

You can claim for:
- Faulty goods
- Poor workmanship
- Refunds or compensation
- Breach of contract
- Misrepresentation

Court fees depend on the value of your claim, and you may recover them if you win.

## Use Additional Pressure Points

Even without Trading Standards, you still have leverage:

- Use Section 75 or chargeback if you paid by card
- Leave factual, non-defamatory reviews
- Report the trader to their trade association
- Escalate to an Ombudsman if the sector has one

These routes can sometimes prompt action faster than enforcement bodies.

## Being Ignored Does Not Mean You Are Powerless

Trading Standards not responding is frustrating, but it isn't the end of the road. Civil claims exist to help you resolve individual disputes yourself.

With the right steps, the right wording and the right evidence, you can still get a fair outcome.
